QUESTION-29
The cosmetic company “BeautifyMe” has decided to reward its brand promoters with a batch of cosmetics. Each batch is identified by a unique numeric barcode. Each digit of the barcode number represents a product ID of the products present in the batch. Before distributing the products to its promoters, the company wants to make sure that all products present in the batch are still fresh and safe to use. The distribution center has therefore been advised to identify the oldest product in each batch is the one with the smallest product ID. There can be multiplies of the same product in one batch.

An e-commerce website wishes to find the lucky customer who will be eligible for full value cash back. For this purpose, a number N is fed to the system. It will return another number that is calculated by an algorithm. In the algorithm, a sequence is generated, in which each number is the sum of the two proceeding numbers. Initially the sequence will have two 1’s in it. The system will return the Nth number from the generated sequence which is treated as the order ID. The lucky customer will be the one who has placed that order. Write an algorithm to help the website find the lucky customer.
The sequence generated by the system will be 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21......
